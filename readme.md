### Stock Watcher

An interface between users and their grocery stores. Stores can upload their inventory data onto the website, which can let users know what the stocks look like. Users can search for items, like bread, for example, and see the inventory levels of nearby grocery stores. Built during the hack:now hackathon over April 24th-26th, using ReactJS, Django, and Google App Engine.
