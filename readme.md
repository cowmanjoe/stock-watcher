### Stock Watcher

An interface between users and their grocery stores. Stores can upload their inventory data onto the website, which can let users know the stock level of in-demand items. Users can search for items, like bread, for example, and see the inventory levels of nearby grocery stores. Built during the hack:now hackathon over April 24th-26th, using ReactJS, Django, and Google App Engine.
